This CSS starter is intended provide you with a number of common starting options, and some guidance as to what to choose 
for options that aren't provided. It makes heavy use of principles I've learned from [Josh Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/)'s superlative [CSS For JS Developers](https://css-for-js.dev/) and [Adam Wathan](https://adamwathan.me/) & [Steve Schoger](https://twitter.com/steveschoger)'s [Refactoring UI](https://www.refactoringui.com/book), so make sure to check those out 
for a more in-depth look at the underlying principles!
